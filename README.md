# B2B-Mpesa-paybill-API
This API will enable your system or application to pay from your paybill number to another 
This is just Gibberish statements. We will organize our thoughts later

There are basically two portals that we will need to have in our mind. The MPESA BUSINESS PORTAL(https://pay.m-pesaforbusiness.co.ke) and the MPESA ORGANIZATION PORTAL(https://org.ke.m-pesa.com) We will see their importance later.

Basically the organization portal will help us create operators with the correct user roles that are required to in the request body parameter of the b2b. that is the initiator and the secuirity credentials . We will see how they come about and how to create these users. 
On the mpesa Business portal we will to create some users to manage transactions especially b2b intra transfer we will also come back to this.

Something else I wanna throw here is that the organisation portal will be mainly for the apis but the business portal is mainly now managing your business account for the paybill. 
First thing you should know is the   G2 portal (organization portal) is the one that is created first because after you apply for a paybill using the form I willprodive the form link, this first step is that the mpesa support team helps you create the G2 portal. So the only way you can have the Business portal is if you already have the G2 portal
